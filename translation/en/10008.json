It has become the technical standard for all smart contracts implementing fungible tokens (tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain.\nERC-20 standard functions include: transferring tokens from one account to another; obtaining the current token balance of an account; obtaining the total token supply; approving a certain amount of tokens in the account for use by a third-party account.",
