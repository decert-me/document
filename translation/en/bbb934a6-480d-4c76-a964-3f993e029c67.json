  "description": "Uniswap V2 is a decentralized exchange (DEX) running on the Ethereum blockchain, which is the second version of the Uniswap protocol. Uniswap V2 introduces multiple improvements and new features based on its predecessor, further strengthening its role in decentralized finance (DeFi). By learning the UniswapV2 AMM principle, you can address 95% of Dex interaction requirements in your work.",
