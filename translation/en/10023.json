    "title": "On-chain Data Training Camp L6",
    "description": "This course aims to test and deepen students' basic understanding of blockchain technology, the Ethereum platform, and smart contracts through a series of multiple-choice questions. The content will cover basic concepts of blockchain, data structures, core technologies and principles, as well as practical applications on Ethereum, such as how to query transactions through Ethereum's Remote Procedure Call (RPC), how to retrieve the balance of a specific address in a particular ERC-20 or ERC-721 token contract, and how to obtain metadata for specific tokens. In addition, this course will also delve into issues related to blockchain data, such as data immutability, data retrieval efficiency, and data scalability. Through this course, students will be better equipped to grasp the core concepts of blockchain and Ethereum technology, laying a solid foundation for future research and practical applications.",
