      "title": "Simulate the minting of ERC20 tokens with inscriptions on Ethereum, and write a factory contract that can create ERC20 through the minimum proxy. The factory contract contains two methods:\n\n• `deployInscription(string name, string symbol, uint totalSupply, uint perMint)`, which users call to create an ERC20 contract\n\n• `mintInscription(address tokenAddr)`: Issues the `perMint` quantity of tokens determined at the time of creation each time it is called. \n\nPlease reply with code or a code repository link."
