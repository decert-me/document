  "description": "ChainLink is a decentralized oracle network designed to be a bridge between blockchain and real-world data. The on-chain DataFeed service provided by ChainLink is a key feature that allows any smart contract to securely read the price of Ethereum (ETH) and real-time data of various cryptocurrencies and traditional assets. This service is achieved through ChainLink's decentralized oracle network, where nodes in the network collect price information from different data sources and then process and aggregate this data through aggregation contracts to provide an accurate and trusted average price.",
